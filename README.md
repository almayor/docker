# Acknowledgements

I have learned a lot about Docker and how it works but following an **excellent** [tutorial](https://learndocker.online) by [Julian Fahrer](https://github.com/jfahrer). He is an outstanding teacher and human being, and I wish him all the best. As always, I am also grateful to the entire team behind School 42 and its [Moscow branch](https://21-school.ru
), as well as to my fellow students for help and support. Finally, the example of a Ruby on Rails app in [01_dockerfiles/ex02](01_dockerfiles/ex02) is taken from [Codefresh](https://github.com/codefresh-contrib).
